# Computer Graphics course project (ICS7, 5th sem) by Aksenov E. Y.

Here's some beatiful docs (can be clonned and modified unsing Google Docs) and a very shitty code.

A lot of algorithms, that work pretty fine. Base of this project is written by @slevinsps (https://github.com/slevinsps). Thanks a lot for it, dude)

Even if I had refactored it many times, it still contains some shitcode (without string==string comparisons at least). Anyway, if you've got something to improve or ada, feel free to create PRs to contribute.
